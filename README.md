## Description
The program calculates the count of all unique cards which are possible in the game Tsuro. All possible 105 (7 * 5 * 3 * 1) cards are generated before the program is run (either by inputting them via GeneratedCards.txt file and load them or via the integrated functions). After the generation of all possible cards duplicate cards (the ones who have rotation symmetry) are removed and the final count is outputted to the console.
